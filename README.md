# Heart-disease-Prediction-using-decision-tree-classifier
In this case study, I delve into the realm of predictive healthcare by employing a Decision Tree Classifier to predict heart disease. The study begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we analyze and preprocess the dataset to gain insights into its characteristics. Visualizations are created to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.Moving forward, the study explores the art of hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross-Validation, enhancing the Decision Tree's performance through optimized parameter selection. This step maximizes the model's predictive accuracy and generalizability.One unique aspect of this case study is the manual demonstration of the concept of "max depth." By carefully adjusting the maximum depth of the Decision Tree, i showcased the impact of this parameter on the model's complexity and its ability to capture finer details or avoid overfitting.
